## Description
**EM2U300** is a superheavy cargo transport designed and manufactured by **Fener Space Infrastructure**. It is designed to carry containerized cargo in large 
quantities across the core regions of human populated space.

A full ship is comprised of two sections, the propulsion/utility module and the "cargo wagon", allowing the propulsion module to act like a tractor and the 
wagon as the trailer. The propulsion module can deliver a wagon to its destination, decouple it and quickly attach another wagon that has already been readied 
for transport, saving precious time that would otherwise cost precious time and money. The same thing is possible with propellant tanks - the tanks can be 
left for refilling at the stations that have the appropriate facilities to be picked up later, after they are refilled and re-sealed. To save weight, 
the ships often do not carry the full set of 6 propellant tanks, unless they are meant to travel really long distances in one go.

## History
EM2U300 is the first spaceship developed by Fener Space Infrastructure. 

Spacecraft design and manufacturing is not one of the well known enterprises of Fener. Founded in 2782, the company had started off as a 
manufacturer of deep space communication, signaling, navigation aiding and telescope systems for planetary installments, space stations and large 
exploration vessels; and it still does most of its business as such. EM2U300 was just an interesting attempt at entering new markets for Fener.

In 2915, the company started its first research and development project to design an orbital station that could act as a targeting beacon for ships 
travelling through hyperspace for more accurate jumps. However, with the hyperdrive technology improving faster than anticipated, the project was scrapped. 
After a 10 year pause in major R&D operations, the management decided that it was time for a bigger step to stay competitive in the market for a long time. 
The need for large space infrastructure projects were declining, but it was clear that the need for more and bigger spaceships was to grow as humanity 
reached farther into distant star systems. 

Some parts of the scrapped project were brought back from the archives; the systems originally designed for a space station were repurposed for 
a cargo spaceship. Fener also had minor engineering support from OPLI-Barnard. The result was EM2U300, a boring but quite economical container transport 
vehicle.
